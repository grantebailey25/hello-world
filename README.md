# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
Right now, I am in the summer between my Freshman and Sophmore year at Loyola University Chicago.
I'm a Computer Science and Data Science double major, and I am on the soccer team.
I've learned a bit about java in my first year, but I want to get into and explore Python, which I am starting to get into now.
I want to use GitHub to pull from others and aid others in creating great projects with all of the languages that I learn.
